<h1>Snake Game AI</h1><p>The Snake Game AI is a web-based game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is an implementation of the classic Snake game, where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food. However, this version includes an AI algorithm that controls the snake automatically.</p><h2>How to Play</h2><ol><li>Open the <code>index.html</code> file in your web browser.</li><li>The game grid will be displayed with a snake and food.</li><li>The snake will start moving automatically, controlled by the AI algorithm.</li><li>The goal is to eat the food and grow longer without hitting the walls or the snake's own body.</li><li>The game ends if the snake collides with any obstacle.</li><li>To restart the game, simply refresh the page.</li></ol><h2>Files</h2><p>The project contains the following files:</p><ul><li><code>index.html</code>: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the game and handles user interactions.</li><li><code>styles.css</code>: The CSS file that provides styles and layout for the game.</li><li><code>script.js</code>: The JavaScript file that implements the game logic, including snake movement, food generation, collision detection, and AI algorithm.</li></ul><h2>Customization</h2><p>You can customize the Snake Game AI by modifying the following aspects:</p><ul><li>Grid Size: By default, the game grid is set to a specific size. You can modify the HTML structure and CSS to change the grid dimensions.</li><li>AI Algorithm: The snake's movement is controlled by an AI algorithm implemented in the JavaScript code. You can modify the algorithm to create your own AI or experiment with different strategies.</li><li>Styling: Feel free to modify the CSS file to change the appearance of the game, such as colors, fonts, or animations.</li></ul><h2>Browser Compatibility</h2><p>The Snake Game AI is built using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and should be compatible with most modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.</p><h2>License</h2><p>This project is licensed under the <a>MIT License</a>.
